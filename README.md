## Introduction
This repository executes 2 functions:
- to run PostgreSQL in container and to fill one by data for studying; 
- to store my homework (.sql files in generally) from [SQL course](https://www.udemy.com/course/bestpostgres).

## Run PostgreSQL
1. create and activate virtual environment;
2. run command `make run`;
3. connect to DB in pgAdmin.

## Some notes
You have to install Colima to use Docker on MacOS. [This article](https://aosolorzano.medium.com/installing-colima-as-a-docker-engine-provider-with-buildx-and-compose-plugins-installed-1ce8b3bae158) is going to help you.
